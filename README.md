# Stata-code - Stata commands and do files that help produce publication-quality graphs

#### *Stata version 15 or later* may be required for some commands provided in this repo.

### **Background**

I wrote all of the code in this repo based on figures I saw online (often plotted using R), in scholarly works, or developed in response the needs of various projects I have been working on in the last couple of years. 

My goal is to provide Stata (and occasionally R) users outside of my reach with helpful commands/solutions, and help them make more beautiful, publication-quality plots using Stata. 

### **Feedback and Requests**

Please provide feedback by creating an issue. You can read the issues previously submitted by others or create a new one using the top menu. 

If you have a better idea, fix, or improvement in mind, and if you have a suggestion or need a new feature/addition, please feel free to send me an email.

### **Content**
!This part will be edited.

### **Contributions**

I am very new to GitHub, which is often argued to be a great tool for collaboration. I welcome any and all contributions, and will of course acknowledge those who do so.

The Stata files (*dta or *do) on the master branch are the most recent ones. I will also try (hopefully not forget) to update the README and other similar files as needed.

If you would like to make a contribution to any Stata file, please do not use the master branch. You can pull stuff from the develop branch, which includes already published versions and, if any, minor edits.
