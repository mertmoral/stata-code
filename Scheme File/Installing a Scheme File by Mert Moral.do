* Download "mmoral3" scheme to your computer.
* Right-click and copy the scheme file.
* For Mac, go (In Finder, Shift+Command+G or select Go/Go To Folder) "/Applications/Stata 15/ado/base/s" folder and simply paste the scheme file to the folder.
* For Windows, the target folder is (possibly) "C:\Program Files\Stata15\ado\base/s"

sysdir	/* Depending on your operating system and Stata version, this command shows where to paste a downloaded/created scheme file on your computer */
